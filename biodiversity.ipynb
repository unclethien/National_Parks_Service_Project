    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Biodiversity is essential to ecosystem health, but is threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and other human activities. National parks aim to conserve wildlife, but even protected areas experience biodiversity declines. Tracking species distributions and conservation status in parks can inform management efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes National Park Service biodiversity data to understand species status and distributions in national parks. Key questions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for observed species? Are certain species more endangered?\n",
    "- How does species prevalence differ between parks? Which species are most widespread?\n",
    "- Are there significant differences between species and their conservation status?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data sources:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional."

    "## Scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining a clear project scope provides direction and focus when starting a new data analysis project. This scope contains four key sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Goals: The high-level objectives and intentions for the project. What questions are we trying to answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data: Reviewing the available data to ensure it can support the project goals. For this project, biodiversity data has already been obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analysis Plan: The methods and specific research questions to analyze the data and meet the goals. What techniques and visualizations will be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluation: Drawing conclusions from the analysis to arrive at findings and insights that achieve the project goals. What stories does the data tell us?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project the perspective will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. My goal is to help conserve at-risk species and maintain biodiversity within the national parks. My key objectives are to analyze species characteristics, conservation status, and distributions across parks. Specifically, I aim to explore these questions:\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for observed species? Are certain species more endangered?\n",
    "- How does species prevalence differ between parks? Which species are most widespread?\n",
    "- Are there significant differences between species and their conservation status?\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing biodiversity data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to these questions, I aim to generate data-driven recommendations to help guide conservation priorities and actions across national parks. My goal is to support the Park Service mission of protecting vulnerable species.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has two data sets that came with the package. The first `csv` file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distributions\n",
    "1. counts\n",
    "1. relationship between species\n",
    "1. conservation status of species\n",
    "1. observations of species in parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it's a good idea to revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies.\n"
